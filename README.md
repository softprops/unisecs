> Unix epoch time representation that anyone can wear

## ðŸ¤” About

Why not [`std::time`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/index.html)? Rust's `std::time` package provides two representations of time `SystemTime` and `Instant`. Often times you will need to work with an api that requires specifically [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) which typically is represented in terms of seconds. `std::time` representations are general purpose can can be made to represent unix time but not in a very straightforward or ergonomic way.

This crate does focuses specifically on that in addition to represented subsecond time for the purposes of capturing a more accuate measurement of a duration.

Unix seconds is a type of duration, anchored from a starting point of `00:00:00 UTC Thursday, 1 January 1970`. On most unix-based systems you can get this time on the command line with `date +%s`. This crate aims to provide similiar convenience in addition to having good interop with other features in `std::time` module.

## ðŸ“¦ Install

In your Cargo.toml file, add the following under the [dependencies] heading

```toml
unisecs = "0.1"
```

## Usage

```rust
fn main() {
  println!(
    "{}", unixsecs::Seconds::now()
  );
}
```
